# Steering wheel project
This is a project for a steering wheel for a solar powered car. This steering wheel will be able to show multiple continously updated variables about the car and is built for the possibility of using a menu that could be used to extent its functionality. This repo is only for the software part of the steering wheel.

## Status of project
At this moment this is only a functional prototype and all the functional code is located in the "develop" branch.
Go to develop branch to se instructions on how to get the program running on a ESP-WROOM-32
